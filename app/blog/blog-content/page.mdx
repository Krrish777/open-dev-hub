## Run Locally

> Before getting into it, make sure you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [prisma](https://prisma.io) installed.

1. Fork the project

2. Clone the repo

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username->/open-dev-hub
```

3. Go into the project directory
   ```sh
    cd open-dev-hub
   ```
4. Create an `.env` file from the `.env.template` file (copy everything in the `.env.template` file and put it in the `.env` file with appropriate values)

   - `MONGODB_URI` is the `connection string` which you'll get from mongodb [for reference](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/).
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` Just pass any `random string` or you can quickly create a good value on the command line via this `openssl command`.
   

   ```sh
    openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

5. Install all the dependencies
   ```sh
   npm / yarn install
   ```
8. Start the application development server
   ```sh

   ```
